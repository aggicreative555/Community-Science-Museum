## Community Science Museum

### *‘’A website which even a kid can navigate with ease’’*

#### Intro:
<p>The COSM website is made for a zero-cost museum organization that wants to provide children (7-14) and their families with opportunities to expand their science knowledge through exhibitions, spaces and events. 
This project provides its young users with an accessible, intuitive and eye-catching website they can navigate easily.<p/>
<p>These are the required user stories:</p>
